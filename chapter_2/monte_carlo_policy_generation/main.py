"""
Monte Carlo techniques solve Markov decision processes (MDPs) by sampling their way to an
estimation of a value function. They can do this without explicit knowledge of the transition
probabilities and can efficiently sample large state spaces. But they need to run for an
entire episode before the agent can update the policy.
