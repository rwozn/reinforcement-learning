Environment specification:

2D grid world with NxM tiles (N=10, M=4).

The objective is to move to the goal tile (at (9, 0)).

- State space: [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1]x[0, 1, 2, ..., M-1] tiles

- Action space: [0 = move left, 1 = move right, 2 = move up, 3 = move down]

- Terminal state:
    - state = goal_tile (win)
    - state âˆˆ cliff_tiles (lose)

- Reward:
    - p (p = 0) when won
    - q (q = -100) when lost
    - r (r = -1) otherwise
