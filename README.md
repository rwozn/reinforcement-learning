# reinforcement-learning
Visualisation of RL concepts and implementation of various RL algorithms from [the book](https://rl-book.com/).
  
Algorithms:
  - on-policy monte carlo
  - value iteration
  - SARSA (on-policy TD)
  - Q-learning (off-policy TD)
  - n-step SARSA
  - SARSA(λ)
  - deep Q network
  - n-step actor-critic
  - REINFORCE
